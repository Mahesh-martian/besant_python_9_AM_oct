    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) History of Python\n",
    "Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s and released in **1991**. It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, emphasizing readability and simplicity. Over time, Python has evolved into a powerful, multi-purpose language used in various domains, from web development to artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) History of Programming Languages\n",
    "- **Binary (Machine Code):** The earliest form of programming, written in 0s and 1s, directly understood by computers.\n",
    "- **Assembly Language:** A low-level language that uses mnemonic codes to represent machine-level instructions, making programming more human-readable.\n",
    "- **C Language:** Developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs, C introduced structured programming and became the foundation for many modern languages.\n",
    "- **Python:** Introduced in 1991, Python brought high-level, interpreted scripting with easy-to-read syntax, making it a widely adopted language today.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) Execution of C and Python Architecture\n",
    "### C Language Execution\n",
    "1. Code is written in C.\n",
    "2. The compiler converts it into machine code.\n",
    "3. The machine executes the binary instructions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Python Execution\n",
    "1. Code is written in Python.\n",
    "2. The interpreter translates it into bytecode.\n",
    "3. The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes the bytecode.\n",
    "4. If necessary, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation optimizes performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) Platform Dependent and Independent Programming Languages\n",
    "- **Platform Dependent:** A language that compiles code specific to an operating system (e.g., **C** compiles differently for Windows and Linux).\n",
    "- **Platform Independent:** A language that runs on multiple operating systems without modification (e.g., **Python**, as it runs via an interpreter).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) Uses of Python\n",
    "Python is widely used in various fields, including:\n",
    "- **Web Development** (Django, Flask)\n",
    "- **Data Science & Machine Learning** (Pandas, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)\n",
    "- **Automation & Scripting**\n",
    "- **Game Development** (Pygame)\n",
    "- **Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking**\n",
    "- **Embedded Systems & IoT**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's versatility, simplicity, and extensive libraries make it one of the most popular programming languages today.\n",

    "## 6) Installation of Python\n",
    "1. Download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n",
    "2. Run the installer and select **Add Python to PATH**.\n",
    "3. Follow the installation prompts.\n",
    "4. Verify installation by running `python --version` in the command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7) IDE for Python\n",
    "### Popular Python IDEs\n",
    "- **PyCharm** - Feature-rich, best for professional developers.\n",
    "- **VS Code** - Lightweight and extensible with plugins.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook** - Ideal for data science and ML projects.\n",
    "- **IDLE** - Comes pre-installed with Python, good for beginners.\n",
    "- **Spyder** - Best suited for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose an IDE based on your needs and workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8) Installation of VS Code\n",
    "1. Download VS Code from the official website: [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "2. Run the installer and follow the installation steps.\n",
    "3. Open VS Code and install the **Python extension** from the Extensions Marketplace.\n",
    "4. Configure VS Code by setting up a virtual environment or selecting the Python interpreter.\n",
    "5. Verify the installation by opening a Python file and running it inside VS Code.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 9) Executing First Python Query\n",
    "1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "2. Type `python` or `python3` to enter the Python interactive shell.\n",
    "---\n",
    "3. Run a simple command like:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   \n",
    "      print(\"Hello world\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Press Enter to execute and see the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can save a Python script \n",
    "`script.py` and run it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "      python Day1.py"
